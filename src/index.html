<p>The pages on this site demonstrate the built-in AI capabilities that are now available as developer previews in Microsoft Edge Canary and Dev. These experimental APIs allow sites and extensions to access AI capabilities via a local version of the Azure Phi-4-minni, a powerful small language model that is built into the browser.</p>

<p>To start using the prompt and writing assistance APIs today in Microsoft Edge Canary or Dev, check out <a href="https://aka.ms/edge-prompt-api-docs">the API documentation</a>, and explore <a href="https://aka.ms/edge-prompt-api-playground-code">the source code of the demo pages on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>To share any feedback about the APIs, please comment on <a href="https://aka.ms/edge-prompt-api-feedback">the feedback GitHub issue</a>.</p>
